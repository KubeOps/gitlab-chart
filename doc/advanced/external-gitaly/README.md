# Configure this chart with External Gitaly

This document intends to provide documentation on how to configure this Helm chart with an external Gitaly service.

The instructions here make use of the [Omnibus GitLab][] package for Ubuntu. This package provides versions of the services that are guaranteed to be compatible with the charts' services.

## Configure the Chart

Disable the `gitaly` chart and the Gitaly service it provides, and point the other services to the external service.

You need to set the following parameters:
* `gitlab.gitaly.enabled`: Set to `false` to disable the included Gitaly chart.
* `global.gitaly.host`: Set to the hostname of the external Gitaly
* `global.gitaly.port`: The port the database is available on, defaults to `8075`
* `global.gitaly.authToken.secret`: The name of the [secret which contains the token for authentication][gitaly-secret].
* `global.gitaly.authToken.key`: The key within the secret, which contains the token content.

For example, pass these values via helm's `--set` flag while deploying:

```
helm install .  \
  --set gitlab.gitaly.enabled=false \
  --set global.gitaly.host=gitaly.pet \
  --set ...
```

## Setup standalone Gitaly

### Create VM with Omnibus GitLab

Create a VM on your provider of choice, or locally. This was tested with VirtualBox, KVM, and Bhyve.
Ensure that the Gitaly instance will be reachable from the cluster.
Install Ubuntu Server onto the VM that you have created. Ensure that `openssh-server` is installed, and that all packages are up to date.
Configure networking and a hostname. Make note of the hostname/IP, and ensure it is both resolvable and reachable from your Kubernetes cluster.
Be sure firewall policies are in place to allow traffic.

Follow the installation instructions for [Omnibus GitLab][]. When you perform the package installation, **_do not_** provide the `EXTERNAL_URL=` value. We do not want automatic configuration to occur, as we'll provide a very specific configuration in the next step.

### Configure Omnibus GitLab

Create a minimal `gitlab.rb` file to be placed at `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`. Be _very_ explicit about what is enabled on this node, use the contents below.

_**NOTE**: The values below should be replaced_
- `AUTH_TOKEN` should be replaced with the value in the [gitaly secret][gitaly-secret]
- `GITLAB_URL` should be replaced with the URL of the GitLab instance
- `SHELL_TOKEN` should be replaced with the value in the [gitlab shell secret](../../installation/secrets.md#gitlab-shell-secret)

```Ruby
## Gitaly
gitaly['auth_token'] = 'AUTH_TOKEN'
gitaly['listen_addr'] = '0.0.0.0:8075'

## Needed to get user made/managed
gitlab_rails['auto_migrate'] = false
## Needed to have GitLab Shell connect to GitLab API
gitlab_rails['internal_api_url'] = 'GITLAB_URL'
gitlab_shell['secret_token'] = 'SHELL_TOKEN'

## Disable everything else
sidekiq['enable'] = false
unicorn['enable'] = false
registry['enable'] = false
gitlab_workhorse['enable'] = false
nginx['enable'] = false
prometheus_monitoring['enable'] = false
postgresql['enable'] = false
redis['enable'] = false
```

After creating `gitlab.rb`, reconfigure the package with `gitlab-ctl reconfigure`. Once the task has completed, check the running processes with `gitlab-ctl status`. The output should appear as such:
```
# gitlab-ctl status
run: gitaly: (pid 30562) 77637s; run: log: (pid 30561) 77637s
run: logrotate: (pid 4856) 1859s; run: log: (pid 31262) 77460s
```
