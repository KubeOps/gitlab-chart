# Cloud Native GitLab Helm Chart

> **Notes**:
* This chart is **alpha**. It should not be used for production deployments.
* There are [known issues and limitations](doc/architecture/alpha.md#known-issues-and-limitations).


We are working on a new cloud native method of deploying GitLab on Kubernetes.

While this is possible today using our [Omnibus GitLab based Docker image](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/docker/README.html) and [corresponding Helm charts](https://gitlab.com/charts/charts.gitlab.io), there are challenges.
One key example is that an "all-in-one container" becomes a challenge to configure and operate at scale.

To address this need we are working on the [Helm chart in this repository](#helm-charts) along with a [new set of Docker containers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/build/CNG) that are specific to each component of GitLab.

Some of the key benefits of the new chart and containers are:
* Improved scalability and reliability
* No requirement for root privileges
* Utilization of object storage instead of NFS for storage

This chart is currently in alpha, and should only be used for testing and development. If you'd like to run GitLab in production today, we recommend using the [`omnibus-gitlab` chart](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/install/kubernetes/gitlab_omnibus.html).
