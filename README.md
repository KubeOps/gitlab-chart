# Cloud Native GitLab Helm Chart

> **Notes**:
* The chart is currently **beta**
* There are [known issues and limitations](doc/architecture/beta.md#known-issues-and-limitations).


We are working on a new cloud native method of deploying GitLab on Kubernetes, using the [Helm chart in this repository](#helm-charts) along with a [new set of Docker containers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/build/CNG) that are specific to each component of GitLab.

The `gitlab` chart is the best way to operate GitLab on Kubernetes. This chart contains all the required components to get started, and can scale to large deployments.

Some of the key benefits of the new chart and containers are:
* Improved scalability and reliability
* No requirement for root privileges
* Utilization of object storage instead of NFS for storage

The default deployment includes:

- Core GitLab components: Unicorn, Shell, Workhorse, Registry, Sidekiq, and Gitaly
- Optional dependencies: Postgres, Redis, Minio
- An auto-scaling, unprivileged [GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/) using the Kubernetes executor
- Automatically provisioned SSL via [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
